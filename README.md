# welcome to geo-tivo!

## preface
geo-tivo is a web-based geography named after my old yellow lab, TiVo. TiVo loved exploring new places and in his short 13 years, he got to explore a lot of them. I wish I could have taken him around the world with me. I got the idea for geo-tivo after watching [this ridiculous Jimmy Kimmel video]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRh1zXFKC_o).

## how to run
1. clone the repository
2. follow the steps to create a google maps API key [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key)
3. paste your api key into the [index.html file on line 58](https://github.com/mayaschwarz/sheppardworld-web/blob/main/json/index.html#L58) where it says **your_api_key_here**
4. run the index.html file
5. profit!
